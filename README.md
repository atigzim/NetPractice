# NetPractice
*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by atigzim.*

## Description

This project is a networking training interface created as part of the 42 curriculum.  
Its goal is to help students understand fundamental networking concepts such as IP addressing, subnetting, routing, and OSI layers through progressive levels.

NetPractice provides an interactive learning environment where students solve real-world networking problems by configuring IP addresses, subnet masks, and routing tables.

Each of the 10 levels increases in complexity, challenging students to apply their knowledge of network segmentation, address allocation, and packet routing to build functional network topologies.

Through hands-on practice, students gain practical experience in designing networks that are efficient, scalable, and properly segmented.  
The project emphasizes understanding how devices communicate across networks, how routers forward packets between different network segments, and how proper IP addressing schemes enable network organization and security.

## Instructions

### Running the Training Interface

1. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser  
   (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge recommended).
2. The interface will load with **Level 1** by default.
3. Navigate between levels using the level selector.
4. Configure the network by filling in:
   - IP addresses
   - Subnet masks
   - Routing information
5. Click the **Check** button to verify your configuration.
6. If successful, proceed to the next level.

### Exporting Configurations

1. Complete each level by correctly configuring all network parameters.
2. Once a level is validated, click the **Export** button.
3. The configuration will be saved as a JSON file  
   (example: `level1.json`).
4. Save each exported file with its corresponding level number.

### Submission Requirements

- All **10 exported configuration files** (`level1.json` through `level10.json`)
  must be placed at the **root of the Git repository**.
- This `README.md` file must be included.
- The complete NetPractice training interface files must be included.
